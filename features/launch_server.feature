Feature: Running a Hudson Server
  As a hudson server administrator
  I want to be able to easily control a hudson server
  In order to spend my time on how the process operates, not how to start stop and control it.

  Scenario: Start a Hudson Server (hudson server)
    Given env variable $HOME set to project path "home"
      And "home/.hudson" folder is deleted
      And hudson is using a stock warfile
      And there is nothing listening on port 5001
      And there is nothing listening on port 5002
      And I cleanup any hudson processes with control port 5002
    When I run hudson server with arguments "--port 5001 --control 5002 --daemon --logfile=server.log"
    Then I should see a hudson server on port 5001
      And folder "home/.hudson/server" is created
      And folder "home/.hudson/server/javatmp" is created
